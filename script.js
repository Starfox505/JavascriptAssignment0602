// 1. Create a page that displays a balloon (using the balloon emoji, ðŸŽˆ). When you press
// the up arrow, it should inflate (grow) 10 percent, and when you press the down arrow,
// it should deflate (shrink) 10 percent. You can control the size of text (emoji are
// text) by setting the font-size CSS property (style.fontSize) on its parent element.
// Remember to include a unit in the valueâ€”for example, pixels (10px). The key names of
// the arrow keys are "ArrowUp" and "ArrowDown". Make sure the keys change only the
// balloon, without scrolling the page.
// When that works, add a feature where, if you blow up the balloon past a certain size,
// it explodes. In this case, exploding means that it is replaced with a ðŸ’¥ emoji, and
// the event handler is removed (so that you canâ€™t inflate or deflate the explosion).
// Hint: keeping track of the size in percentage might be easier.
// Hint: Make sure you quote the emoji characters. They are strings, after all.
// Hint: document.getElementById("balloon") will get the balloon element on the page.

//This sets the size function's base level to 20px

function arrow(event) {

    //This decreases the size of the balloon by multiplying it by .9.
    p.textContent = "ðŸŽˆ";
    //This makes the text content back into a balloon again, if you decrease the size of the balloon. This is to prevent the explosion emoji from showing up when decreasing in size.
    event.preventDefault();

// 2. The index.html page has a tabbed layout. Make the default state of the layout show
// the first tab, and make it so that when you click the links at the top the correct
// tab's contents are displayed and the others are hidden. Prevent the default action of
// the links and set up an event listener with the logic necessary to make the tabs
// function as expected. There are many ways to accomplish this task, but you will need
// to at minimum add listeners to each link and toggle the display of the tab contents.
// Hint: display: none; hides an element, and display: block; will bring it
